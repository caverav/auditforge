# Roles

> Auditforge can manage different user account roles to access different kind of data with some level of granularity<br>
> There are 2 builtins roles: user and admin. But additional custom roles can easily be added.

## List of permissions

## Built-In Roles

### user

This role has following permissions:

- audits:create, audits:read, audits:update, audits:delete
- vulnerabilities:read, vulnerability-updates:create
- users:read, roles:read
- clients:create, clients:read, clients:update, clients:delete
- companies:create, companies:read, companies:update, companies:delete
- templates:read
- languages:read, audit-types:read, vulnerability-types:read, vulnerability-categories:read, sections:read, custom-fields:read
- settings:read-public
- classify:all

### admin

This role has full permissions access

## Create additional Roles

Custom roles can be defined in `backend/src/config/roles.json`
The format is:

```
role_name: {
  allows: [], // Array of allowed permissions to access or use '*' for all (admin)
  inherits: [] // Array of inherited users permissions
}
```

A default custom role is already defined as a `report` role for example:

```
"report": {
  "inherits": ["user"],
  "allows": [
    "audits:read-all"
  ]
}
```

This role inherits all `user` permissions but since `user` can only access and modify its own Audits, we add the `audits:read-all` permission to `report` to access all Audits.  
To update and delete all Audits additional `audits:update-all` and `audits:delete-all` would be required.

To be able to properly use the review feature of the application, a reviewer role should be added. This reviewer should have the `audits:review` or `audits:review-all` permissions to be able to review reports. A reviewer with only the `audits:review` permission can only review the reports on which they are assigned. The role could look like the following:

```
"reviewer": {
  "inherits": ["user"],
  "allows": [
    "audits:review"
  ]
}
```

A reviewer with the `audits:review-all` permission should also have the `audits:read-all` permission to be able to take full advantage of the first one. He could look like the following:

```
"reviewer": {
  "inherits": ["user"],
  "allows": [
    "audits:review-all",
    "audits:read-all"
  ]
}
```

Keep in mind that these two roles inherit their permissions from the `user` role, which means that they can also create their own audits. A reviewer cannot review an audit for which he is the creator or a collaborator.
